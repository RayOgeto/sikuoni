## Sikuoni

## Sikuoni is a video chat conferencing website that enables users to be able to communicate via use of video chat. By using the tools readily available by Agora, its quite not complicated actually.

<p> <b>how it works</b>
 1. users that are using the site should have a common key
 2. write down the common key/invite code on the lobby in place.
 3. users will be able to join a conversation with each other after the keys/codes are being put inside.

    HAPPY CHATTING /~R4y
